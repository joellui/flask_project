# Flask Project
Created a whole web page using flask
## Create a virtual environment
Before using Flask create a virtual environment in the pc. 

``` python -m venv flask_project\venv ```

And then to activate the environment use this command in CMD

``` flask_project\venv\Scripts\activate.bat ```

### To install all the packages
This will help you get all the packages in the virtual environment. 

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### For Designing the web [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) was used.

### For Database we used [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
